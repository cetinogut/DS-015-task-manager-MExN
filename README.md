# task-manager-NodeJs-MongoDB

### Task-Manager(NodeJS-MangoDB-ExpressServer)

This is my NodeJS / MongoDB Project

it is a M-E-R-N stack application less React part.

This is an API for task management. 

Users can register and login with email&password.

Once the user logged in he/she can create, see, update, delete their tasks.

They can upload and update profile picture.

The JWT token is set to expire 7 days.

When the user is deleted all task deleted cascade.

Tasks can be retrieved by id.

Next version should have a role-based authorization.
